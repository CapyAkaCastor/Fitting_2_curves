# Fitting_2_curves
Python code function "library" to fit 2 curves that have similar shape together
Works by adjusting the amplitude, the width and the offset a first downsampled signal to a second signal.
Made to try to fit 4Hz data to 120Hz and 120Hz data to 5000Hz data.
Similar fonction would be DTW but it doesn't account for amplitude as far as I know and it can change the shape of the downsample signal.
